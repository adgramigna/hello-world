# hello-world


Hello, my name is Andrew and I am a 22 year graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a Masters in Computer Science. There are some projects I have been working on and would like to use GitHub to save my progress and revert to earlier versions if needed. Future Survivor Contestant.
